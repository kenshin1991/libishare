README for libishare
====================

libishare was developed as a GSoC project for VLMC in 2010 by Rohit Yadav.
There was no C++ library that would provide simple APIs to share video on popular
Internet video sharing sites like YouTube and Vimeo. 
This library simply implements the HTTP/S and REST protocols at the core using 
cross-platform Qt Network APIs. Report bugs to the author or at VLMC's Trac.

USAGE: Directly add the src file(s) in your project and use them accrdingly. If you
change some part of code, simple add your <name> <email> in the authors list, the license
must be retained. You may also want to send a patch to VLMC devel or to me as well.

NOTE: This library, is a part of VLMC, but can be used in other *open source* projects.
If you want to use it in a *commercial software*, contact the developer.
